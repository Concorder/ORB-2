							<p>Here you'll find general topics that might be of interest for your inquiry.</p>
							<h4>How do I view a recipe?</h4>
							<p>When you want to view a recipe at OnlineRecipesbook.com you need to log in. Sign in with the registered e-mail address and password in the top right corner. If you need help remembering your password, simply click on "Forgot password" and we will send you an e-mail.  If you don’t have a user, you can quickly create a profile. You merely have to submit name, e-mail address and pick a password. It's quick and simple.  See an overview of all the recipes by clicking on 'recipes' at the top of the page and click on the recipe you wish to view.  
							Have fun!</p>
							<h4>I don’t know my password. How do I reset it?</h4>
							<p>If you signed up through one of our introductory offers, your password was automatically generated and sent to you by e-mail. If you created a membership on the OnlineRecipesbook.com, you picked your own password.  In any case you can easily retrieve the password if you either forgot it or can't find the e-mail that was sent to you with login information.  All you have to do is go to OnlineRecipesbook.com and click on "Log in" at the top right. You need to select "Forgot password" on the pop up and then enter the e-mail address that you signed up with.  Once you have pressed confirm, you should receive your password in your inbox within a few minutes.  If the e-mail fails to appear, please try checking your "spam folder" as they sometimes mistakenly end up there.  Should the system report an error, try entering any other e-mail address you may have. Perhaps you accidentally signed up with an old e-mail address.  If all fails, feel free to contact customer service.</p>
							<h4>I have never signed up to this website. Why am I being charged?</h4>
							<p>If you have been charged by OnlineRecipesbook.com, it means you have signed up for a VIP membership.   Registration is typically done through one of our introductory offers. The offer gives you a trial membership for a small charge, and often the opportunity to receive a welcome gift.  To know more about your membership, please send an email to support@onlinerecipesbook.com and we will send you the information to your email address.</p>

							<p>Here you'll find general topics that might be of interest for your inquiry.</p>
							<h4>Winnings & Prizes</h4>
							<p>If you are one of the lucky winners at: OnlineRecipesbook.com, you will immediately be sent a message via e-mail.  The winner notification e-mail is sent to the e-mail address that you signed up with. As such it is very important that you provide the correct e-mail address when you sign up at: OnlineRecipesbook.com. Please contact customer service if you realize that you have made a typo or the like.  The winner e-mail is sent automatically when winners are drawn and also serves as a receipt.   All winners have 14 days to claim their prize. After 14 days, all rights to the prize are lost. At: OnlineRecipesbook.com you must validate your winnings in order for them to be paid to you or sent to your address. Your name and your winnings/prizes will be posted on the list of winners when your winnings/prizes are approved by: Onlinerecipesbook.com.</p>
							<h4>How do I validate my membership in order to receive my gift/prize?
							</h4>
							<p>You can validate your membership and thus receive your gift/prize by logging onto OnlineRecipesbook.com.  </p>
							<p>If you are our lucky winner you will automatically be contacted by us via email. To receive your gift, please follow the instructions in the email that will be sent to you. You need to fill in all of the fields.
							Please note that when it comes to user validation documents such as a copy of your passport, driving license or utility bill, you must upload an image file. PDFs and other types of files are not accepted by the system.  Once your information has been approved, you will receive an e-mail confirming this. If you do not receive the e-mail, feel free to contact customer service for assistance or check out "I am not receiving e-mails".  Please also make sure that everything has been filled out properly and sent to us.  Naturally, the gift/prize will automatically be sent to you shortly after the information has been approved.</p>
							<h4>Why was my validation rejected?</h4>
							<p>In order for your membership to be validated, you must upload a valid identification photo such as a copy of your driving license, passport or utility bill showing your name and address. The information disviewed must match your profile. As such, the validation might have been rejected due to not matching.  Another possibility is that the uploaded image is too blurry and we were therefore unable to confirm your information. Try uploading a new picture.  Finally, the system may have identified your registration as an attempt to violate our <a href="http://onlinerecipesbook.com/?page=terms">terms and condition.</a></p>
							<p>OnlineRecipesbook.com does not allow for more than one membership to be created as a way of benefiting further from an introductory offer. Only one welcome gift can be received per household during any given 6 month period.  Please note that the above does not affect your membership which is still active.</p>
							<p>I have received a gift card instead of a physical prize. Why is that?
							If a particular item is out of stock, OnlineRecipesbook.com reserves the right to fulfill their obligation with a different gift of the same value. As such, you might end up receiving a gift card in the mail or a voucher sent pr. e-mail rather than a physical prize.  Please note that this is stated both on the introductory offer that you signed up through and in the <a href="http://onlinerecipesbook.com/?page=terms">terms</a> which you have actively agreed to when signing up.</p>
							<h4>Violation of the rules</h4>
							<p>Prizes and gifts OnlineRecipesbook.com reserves the right to reject a winner if a breach of rules has occurred or if it is deemed that the user has won the prize in a dishonourable manner.  OnlineRecipesbook.com reserves the right to reject any claims for prizes/welcome gifts, if it is considered that these were acquired dishonestly by cheating with, for instance, IP addresses, e-mail addresses, credit cards etc.  The above also applies to the creation of multiple users if OnlineRecipesbook.com deems that this has been done as an attempt to take advantage of various welcome gifts or prizes through campaigns, recipes etc.  The assessment of this is always the right of OnlineRecipesbook.com who can, at any time, reject a user should it be assessed that the user has cheated in accordance with the aforementioned.  If you are found to have cheated in any of the recipes that are available on OnlineRecipesbook.com, this will be reported to the police who will investigate the case as fraud.  Persons under 18 It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to view online recipes and therefore it is not allowed for persons under 18 to be members of OnlineRecipesbook.com.</p>
